## Introduction

This repository contains the software for my protogen fursuit head, which has it's base on the amazing Delta Protogen head made by Coela Can't([@coelacant1](https://github.com/coelacant1)). This software is intended for use with the following electronics:

- 64x32 P3 HUB75 Matrix LED Panels
- Teensy 4.1 with a microSD card
- Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W is preferred) with a camera attatched (runs a separate program, read below)

Feel free to use this software & contact me if you have any problems. Enjoy!
